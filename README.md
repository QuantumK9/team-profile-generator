# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This is a program that generates a webpage based on the input of a Team Manager through CLI. 

The user is asked a number of questions about themselves and then about what types of team members they want to add. 

Depending on their choices, details about the members of their team are asked and filled in. 

When the process is finished, a styled html file is generated displaying the team with all the details entered. 

For this project, classes have been used for different types of employees and validations have been added for the user inputs.
